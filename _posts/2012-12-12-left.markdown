title: My new blog based on Left by Zach Holman
category: posts

Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll][jekyll].

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was
extracted from [zachholman.com][zh], which means it was battle-hardened from
years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear words.

---

You'll want to [get the code][left] and read the README to learn how to
install and set up Left for your own purposes.

If you have any questions, follow and ping Zach on Twitter-
[@holman][twitter].
